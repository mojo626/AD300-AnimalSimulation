For extra credit, I decided to take the assignment further by actually implementing a simulation. I am using java swing as a windowing and graphics library and I am simulating rabbits moving around a world. Terrain is generated with a perlin noise algorithm that I found online and I also randomly generate the position of food in the world. Each rabbit inherits from the Animal class and each tick it evaluates what to do next. It has both hunger and thirst meters and if they get above a certain threshold it will go looking for water or food. Each rabbit has a limited sensing radius, so if it can't find what it is looking for it will randomly wander until it can. If either the hunger or thirst reach a certain level, the rabbit will die. This extends the original assignment by adding simulation and mroe funcitonality to a subclass of animal and showcases inheritance.
